# VNA-Q-Measurements

Here are some documents regarding Q measurement using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA).

The first document is "Q factor measurements, analog and digital," by Darko Kajfez, which, among other topics, describes a reflection-type measurement (i.e. S11).

The second document is "A Tool for Measuring High Q Resonators," by Dick Benson, W1QG, which is a user manual for his MATLAB application that is available on the Mathworks file-exchange site:  https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/68908-a-tool-for-measuring-high-q-resonators?s_tid=srchtitle
